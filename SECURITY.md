# Security Policy

Release Guardian takes security seriously.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in Release Guardian, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately:

- Open a **GitHub Security Advisory** in this repository (preferred), or
- Email: **security@YOURDOMAIN.com** (replace this)  
  If you don’t have a domain email yet, use a dedicated Gmail temporarily.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)
- Affected versions / commit SHA
- Any suggested fix (optional)

## Response timeline

We aim to respond within:

- **72 hours** for acknowledgement
- **7 days** for initial assessment
- **30 days** for a fix plan (severity-dependent)

## Supported versions

Release Guardian is currently in active development. Security fixes will target:

- `main` (latest)
- the most recent tagged release (once releases begin)

Thank you for helping keep Release Guardian safe.
